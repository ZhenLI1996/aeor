{"ladder": ["Old English <span class=\"foreign\">hl\u00e6der</span> \"ladder, steps,\" from Proto-Germanic <span class=\"foreign\">*hlaidri</span> (source also of Old Frisian <span class=\"foreign\">hledere</span>, Middle Dutch <span class=\"foreign\">ledere</span>, Old High German <span class=\"foreign\">leitara</span>, German <span class=\"foreign\">Leiter</span>), from suffixed form of PIE root <a href=\"/word/*klei-\" class=\"crossreference\">*klei-</a> \"to lean\" (source also of Greek <span class=\"foreign\">klimax</span> \"ladder\"). In late Old English, rungs were <span class=\"foreign\">l\u00e6ddrest\u00e6f\u00e6</span> and the side pieces were <span class=\"foreign\">ledder steles</span>. The belief that bad things happen to people who walk under ladders is attested from 1787, but its origin likely is more scientific than superstitious.<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mobile\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px;\" data-ad-slot=\"4000736339\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7093273770345366\"></ins>"]}
