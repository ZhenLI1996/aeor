{"gender": ["c. 1300, \"kind, sort, class, a class or kind of persons or things sharing certain traits,\" from Old French <span class=\"foreign\">gendre</span>, <span class=\"foreign\">genre</span> \"kind, species; character; gender\" (12c., Modern French <span class=\"foreign\">genre</span>), from stem of Latin <span class=\"foreign\">genus</span> (genitive <span class=\"foreign\">generis</span>) \"race, stock, family; kind, rank, order; species,\" also \"(male or female) sex,\" from PIE root <a href=\"/word/*gene-\" class=\"crossreference\">*gene-</a> \"give birth, beget,\" with derivatives referring to procreation and familial and tribal groups.\n\nAlso used in Latin to translate Aristotle's Greek grammatical term <span class=\"foreign\">genos</span>. The grammatical sense is attested in English from late 14c. The <span class=\"foreign\">-d-</span> is a phonetic accretion in Old French (compare <a href=\"/word/sound\" class=\"crossreference\">sound</a> (n.1)).\n\nThe \"male-or-female sex\" sense is attested in English from early 15c. As <a href=\"/word/sex\" class=\"crossreference\">sex</a> (n.) took on erotic qualities in 20c., <span class=\"foreign\">gender</span> came to be the usual English word for \"sex of a human being,\" in which use it was at first regarded as colloquial or humorous. Later often in feminist writing with reference to social attributes as much as biological qualities; this sense first attested 1963. <span class=\"foreign\">Gender-bender</span> is from 1977, popularized from 1980, with reference to pop star David Bowie.<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mobile\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px;\" data-ad-slot=\"4000736339\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7093273770345366\"></ins>", "\"to bring forth,\" late 14c., from Old French <span class=\"foreign\">gendrer</span>, <span class=\"foreign\">genrer</span> \"engender, beget, give birth to,\" from Latin <span class=\"foreign\">generare</span> \"to engender, beget, produce\" (see <a href=\"/word/generation\" class=\"crossreference\">generation</a>).
