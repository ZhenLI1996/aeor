{"hangar": ["1852, \"shed for carriages,\" from French <span class=\"foreign\">hangar</span> \"shed,\" which is of uncertain origin. Probably from Middle French <span class=\"foreign\">hanghart</span> (14c.), which is perhaps an alteration of Middle Dutch <span class=\"foreign\">*ham-gaerd</span> \"enclosure near a house\" [Barnhart, Watkins], from a Proto-Germanic compound <span class=\"foreign\">*haimgardaz</span> of the elements that make <a href=\"/word/home\" class=\"crossreference\">home</a> (n.) and <a href=\"/word/yard\" class=\"crossreference\">yard</a> (n.1). Or the Middle French word might be from Medieval Latin <span class=\"foreign\">angarium</span> \"shed in which horses are shod\" [Gamillscheg, Klein]. Sense of \"covered shed for airplanes\" first recorded in English 1902, from French use in that sense.<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mobile\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px;\" data-ad-slot=\"4000736339\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7093273770345366\"></ins>"]}
