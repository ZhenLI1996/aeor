{"sugar": ["late 13c., <span class=\"foreign\">sugre</span>, from Old French <span class=\"foreign\">sucre</span> \"sugar\" (12c.), from Medieval Latin <span class=\"foreign\">succarum</span>, from Arabic <span class=\"foreign\">sukkar</span>, from Persian <span class=\"foreign\">shakar</span>, from Sanskrit <span class=\"foreign\">sharkara</span> \"ground or candied sugar,\" originally \"grit, gravel\" (cognate with Greek <span class=\"foreign\">kroke</span> \"pebble\").

The Spaniards in the West Indies began raising sugar cane in 1506; first grown in Cuba 1523; first cultivated in Brazil 1532.

The pronunciation shift from <span class=\"foreign\">s-</span> to <span class=\"foreign\">sh-</span> is probably from the initial long vowel sound <span class=\"foreign\">syu-</span> (as in <a href=\"/word/sure\" class=\"crossreference\">sure</a>).\n\nAs a type of chemical compound from 1826.
