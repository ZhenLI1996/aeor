{"river": ["early 13c., from Anglo-French <span class=\"foreign\">rivere</span>, Old French <span class=\"foreign\">riviere</span> \"river, riverside, river bank\" (12c.), from Vulgar Latin <span class=\"foreign\">*riparia</span> \"riverbank, seashore, river\" (source also of Spanish <span class=\"foreign\">ribera</span>, Italian <span class=\"foreign\">riviera</span>), noun use of fem. of Latin <span class=\"foreign\">riparius</span> \"of a riverbank\" (see <a href=\"/word/riparian\" class=\"crossreference\">riparian</a>). Generalized sense of \"a copious flow\" of anything is from late 14c. The Old English word was <span class=\"foreign\">ea</span> \"river,\" cognate with Gothic <span class=\"foreign\">ahwa</span>, Latin <span class=\"foreign\">aqua</span> (see <a href=\"/word/aqua-\" class=\"crossreference\">aqua-</a>). Romanic cognate words tend to retain the sense \"river bank\" as the main one, or else the secondary Latin sense \"coast of the sea\" (compare <a href=\"/word/Riviera\" class=\"crossreference\">Riviera</a>).\n\nU.S. slang phrase <span class=\"foreign\">up the river</span> \"in prison\" (1891) is originally in reference to Sing Sing prison, which was literally \"up the (Hudson) river\" from New York City. Phrase <span class=\"foreign\">down the river</span> \"done for, finished\" perhaps echoes sense in <span class=\"foreign\">sell down the river</span> (1851), originally of troublesome slaves, to sell from the Upper South to the harsher cotton plantations of the Deep South.<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mobile\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px;\" data-ad-slot=\"4000736339\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7093273770345366\"></ins>"]}
