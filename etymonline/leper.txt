{"leper": ["\"one afflicted with leprosy,\" late 14c., earlier \"the disease leprosy,\" from Late Latin <span class=\"foreign\">lepra</span>, from Greek <span class=\"foreign\">lepra</span> \"leprosy,\" noun use of fem. of <span class=\"foreign\">lepros</span> (adj.) \"scaly, scabby, rough, leprous,\" related to <span class=\"foreign\">lepein</span> \"to peel,\" from <span class=\"foreign\">lepos</span>, <span class=\"foreign\">lepis</span> \"a scale,\" from PIE root <span class=\"foreign\">*lep-</span> (1) \"to peel,\" which also yields words for \"something delicate and weak,\" via the notion of \"small shaving, flake, scale\" (cognates: Latin <span class=\"foreign\">lepidus</span> \"pleasant, charming, fine, elegant, effeminate,\" <span class=\"foreign\">lepos</span> \"pleasantness, agreeableness;\" Old English <span class=\"foreign\">l\u00e6fer</span> \"rush, reed; metal plate;\" Lithuanian <span class=\"foreign\">lopas</span> \"patch, rag, cloth,\" <span class=\"foreign\">lepus</span> \"soft, weak, effeminate\").\n\nOriginally in Middle English this was the word for the disease itself (mid-13c., via Old French <span class=\"foreign\">lepre</span>); the shift in meaning to \"person with leprosy\" perhaps developed in Anglo-French, or is because the <span class=\"foreign\">-er</span> ending resembled an agent-noun affix. By mid-15c. other nouns for the disease were being coined (see <a href=\"/word/leprosy\" class=\"crossreference\">leprosy</a>). In English <span class=\"foreign\">lepra</span> also was an old name for psoriasis (late 14c.).<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mobile\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px;\" data-ad-slot=\"4000736339\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7093273770345366\"></ins>"]}
