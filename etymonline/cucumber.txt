{"cucumber": ["late 14c., from Old French <span class=\"foreign\">cocombre</span> (13c., Modern French <span class=\"foreign\">concombre</span>), from Latin <span class=\"foreign\">cucumerem</span> (nominative <span class=\"foreign\">cucumis</span>), perhaps from a pre-Italic Mediterranean language. The Latin word also is the source of Italian <span class=\"foreign\">cocomero</span>, Spanish <span class=\"foreign\">cohombro</span>, Portuguese <span class=\"foreign\">cogombro</span>. Replaced Old English <span class=\"foreign\">eor\u00fe\u00e6ppla</span> (plural), literally \"earth-apples.\"\n\n<span class=\"foreign\">Cowcumber</span> was common form 17c.-18c., and that pronunciation lingered into 19c. Planted as a garden vegetable by 1609 by Jamestown colonists. Phrase <span class=\"foreign\">cool as a cucumber</span> (c. 1732) embodies ancient folk knowledge confirmed by science in 1970: inside of a field cucumber on a warm day is 20 degrees cooler than the air temperature.<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mobile\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px;\" data-ad-slot=\"4000736339\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7093273770345366\"></ins>"]}
