{"lobster": ["large, long-tailed, stalk-eyed, 10-legged marine shellfish (Homarus vulgaris), early Middle English <span class=\"foreign\">lopster</span>, <span class=\"foreign\">lopister</span>, from Old English <span class=\"foreign\">loppestre</span> \"lobster,\" also \"locust,\" a corruption of Latin <span class=\"foreign\">locusta</span>, <span class=\"foreign\">lucusta</span> \"locust, grasshopper,\" which is of unknown origin. De Vaan writes that \"The only word similar in form and meaning is <span class=\"foreign\">lacerta</span> 'lizard; mackerel', but there is no common preform in sight. ... [T]hey could be cognate words in the language from which Latin borrowed these forms.\" \n\nThe change of Latin <span class=\"foreign\">-c-</span> to English <span class=\"foreign\">-p-</span> (and, from late 14c., to <span class=\"foreign\">-b-</span>) is unexplained; perhaps it is by influence of Old English <span class=\"foreign\">loppe</span>, <span class=\"foreign\">lobbe</span> \"spider.\" The ending seems to have been altered by the old fem. agent noun suffix (preserved in <span class=\"foreign\">Baxter</span>, <span class=\"foreign\">Webster</span>, etc.; see <a href=\"/word/-ster\" class=\"crossreference\">-ster</a>), which approximated the sound of Latin <span class=\"foreign\">-sta</span>. \n\nOED says the Latin word originally meant \"lobster or some similar crustacean, the application to the locust being suggested by the resemblance in shape.\" Trilobite fossils in Worcestershire limestone quarries were known colloquially as <span class=\"foreign\">locusts</span>, which seems to have been the generic word for \"unidentified arthropod\" (as <span class=\"foreign\">apple</span> was for \"foreign fruit\"). <span class=\"foreign\">Locusta</span> in the sense \"lobster\" also appears in Old Cornish <span class=\"foreign\">legast</span> and French <span class=\"foreign\">langouste</span> (12c.), now \"crawfish, crayfish,\" but in Old French both \"lobster\" and \"locust\" (a 13c. psalter has God giving over the crops of Egypt to the <span class=\"foreign\">langoustes</span>).\n\nAs slang for \"a British soldier\" since 1640s, originally in reference to the jointed armor of the Roundhead cuirassiers, later (1660) to the red coat, the color of a boiled lobster.<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mobile\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px;\" data-ad-slot=\"4000736339\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7093273770345366\"></ins><blockquote>Sir William Waller having received from London [in June 1643] a fresh regiment of five hundred horse, under the command of sir Arthur Haslerigge, which were so prodigiously armed that they were called by the other side the regiment of lobsters, because of their bright iron shells with which they were covered, being perfect curasseers.
