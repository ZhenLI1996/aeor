{"stationer": ["\"book-dealer, seller of books and paper,\" early 14c. (late 13c. as a surname), from Medieval Latin <span class=\"foreign\">stationarius</span> \"tradesman who sells from a station or shop,\" noun use of Latin <span class=\"foreign\">stationarius</span> (see <a href=\"/word/stationary\" class=\"crossreference\">stationary</a>). Roving peddlers were the norm in the Middle Ages; sellers with a fixed location often were bookshops licensed by universities; hence the word acquired a more specific sense than its etymological one.<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mobile\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px;\" data-ad-slot=\"4000736339\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7093273770345366\"></ins>"]}
