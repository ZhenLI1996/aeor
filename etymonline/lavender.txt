{"lavender": ["\"fragrant plant of the mint family,\" c. 1300, from Anglo-French <span class=\"foreign\">lavendre</span>, Old French <span class=\"foreign\">lavendre</span> \"the lavender plant,\" from Medieval Latin <span class=\"foreign\">lavendula</span> \"lavender\" (10c.), perhaps from Latin <span class=\"foreign\">lividus</span> \"bluish, livid.\" If so, it probably was associated with French <span class=\"foreign\">lavande</span>, Italian <span class=\"foreign\">lavanda</span> \"a washing\" (from Latin <span class=\"foreign\">lavare</span> \"to wash;\" from PIE root <a href=\"/word/*leue-\" class=\"crossreference\">*leue-</a> \"to wash\") because it was used to scent washed fabrics and as a bath perfume.\n\nThe adjective meaning \"of a pale purple color, of the color of lavender flowers\" is from 1840; as a noun in the color sense from 1882. An identical Middle English word meant \"laundress, washerwoman;\" also, apparently, \"prostitute, whore; camp follower\" and is attested as a surname from early 13c.<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mobile\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px;\" data-ad-slot=\"4000736339\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7093273770345366\"></ins>"]}
