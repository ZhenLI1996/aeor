{"hamburger": ["1610s, <span class=\"foreign\">Hamburger</span> \"native of <a href=\"/word/Hamburg\" class=\"crossreference\">Hamburg</a>.\" Also used of ships from Hamburg. From 1838 as a type of excellent black grape indigenous to Tyrolia; 1857 as a variety of hen; the meat product so called from 1880 (as <span class=\"foreign\">hamburg steak</span>), named for the German city, though no certain connection has ever been put forth, and there may not be one unless it be that Hamburg was a major port of departure for German immigrants to United States. Meaning \"a sandwich consisting of a bun and a patty of grilled hamburger meat\" attested by 1909, short for <span class=\"foreign\">hamburger sandwich</span> (1902). Shortened form <span class=\"foreign\">burger</span> attested from 1939; <span class=\"foreign\">beefburger</span> was attempted 1940, in an attempt to make the main ingredient more explicit, after the <span class=\"foreign\">-burger</span> had taken on a life of its own as a suffix (compare <span class=\"foreign\">cheeseburger</span>, first attested 1938).<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mobile\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px;\" data-ad-slot=\"4000736339\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7093273770345366\"></ins>"]}
