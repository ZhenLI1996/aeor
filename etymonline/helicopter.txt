{"helicopter": ["1861, from French <span class=\"foreign\">h\u00e9licopt\u00e8re</span> \"device for enabling airplanes to rise perpendicularly,\" thus \"flying machine propelled by screws.\" From Greek <span class=\"foreign\">helix</span> (genitive <span class=\"foreign\">helikos</span>) \"spiral\" (see <a href=\"/word/helix\" class=\"crossreference\">helix</a>) + <span class=\"foreign\">pteron</span> \"wing\" (see <a href=\"/word/ptero-\" class=\"crossreference\">ptero-</a>).\n\nThe idea was to gain lift from spiral aerofoils, and it didn't work. Used by Jules Verne and the Wright Brothers, the word was transferred to helicopters in the modern sense when those were developed in the 1920s. Nativized in Flemish as <span class=\"foreign\">wentelwiek</span> \"with rotary vanes.\"<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mobile\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px;\" data-ad-slot=\"4000736339\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7093273770345366\"></ins>"]}
