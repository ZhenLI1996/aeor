{"amber": ["mid-14c., <span class=\"foreign\">ambre grice</span> \"ambergris; perfume made from ambergris,\" from the phrase in Old French (13c.) and Medieval Latin, from Arabic <span class=\"foreign\">'anbar</span> \"ambergris, morbid secretion of sperm-whale intestines used in perfumes and cookery\" (see <a href=\"/word/ambergris\" class=\"crossreference\">ambergris</a>), which was introduced in the West at the time of the Crusades. Arabic <span class=\"foreign\">-nb-</span> often is pronounced \"-mb-.\"\n\nIn Europe, <span class=\"foreign\">amber</span> was extended to fossil resins from the Baltic (late 13c. in Anglo-Latin; c. 1400 in English), and this has become the main sense as the use of ambergris has waned. Perhaps the perceived connection is that both were found washed up on seashores. Or perhaps it is a different word entirely, of unknown origin. Formerly they were distinguished as <span class=\"foreign\">white</span> or <span class=\"foreign\">yellow amber</span> for the Baltic fossil resin and <span class=\"foreign\">ambergris</span> \"gray amber;\" French distinguished the two substances as <span class=\"foreign\">ambre gris</span> and <span class=\"foreign\">amber jaune</span>.\n\nRemarkable for its static electricity properties, Baltic amber was known to the Romans as <span class=\"foreign\">electrum</span> (compare <a href=\"/word/electric\" class=\"crossreference\">electric</a>). <span class=\"foreign\">Amber</span> as an adjective in English is from c. 1500; as a color name 1735. In the Old Testament it translates Hebrew <span class=\"foreign\">chashmal</span>, a shining metal.<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mobile\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px;\" data-ad-slot=\"4000736339\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7093273770345366\"></ins>"]}
