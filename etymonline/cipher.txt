{"cipher": ["late 14c., \"arithmetical symbol for zero,\" from Old French <span class=\"foreign\">cifre</span> \"nought, zero,\" Medieval Latin <span class=\"foreign\">cifra</span>, with Spanish and Italian <span class=\"foreign\">cifra</span>, ultimately from Arabic <span class=\"foreign\">sifr</span> \"zero,\" literally \"empty, nothing,\" from <span class=\"foreign\">safara</span> \"to be empty;\" loan-translation of Sanskrit <span class=\"foreign\">sunya-s</span> \"empty.\" The word came to Europe with Arabic numerals. Originally in English \"zero,\" then \"any numeral\" (early 15c.), then (first in French and Italian) \"secret way of writing; coded message\" (a sense first attested in English 1520s), because early codes often substituted numbers for letters. Klein says Modern French <span class=\"foreign\">chiffre</span> is from Italian <span class=\"foreign\">cifra</span>.<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mobile\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px;\" data-ad-slot=\"4000736339\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7093273770345366\"></ins>", "\"to do arithmetic\" (with Arabic numerals), 1520s, from <a href=\"/word/cipher\" class=\"crossreference\">cipher</a> (n.).
