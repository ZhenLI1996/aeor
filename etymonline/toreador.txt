{"toreador": ["\"bullfighter on horseback\" (as opposed to a <span class=\"foreign\">torero</span>, who kills on foot), 1610s, from Spanish <span class=\"foreign\">toreador</span>, from <span class=\"foreign\">torear</span> \"to participate in a bullfight,\" from <span class=\"foreign\">toro</span> \"bull,\" from Latin <span class=\"foreign\">taurus</span> (see <a href=\"/word/Taurus\" class=\"crossreference\">Taurus</a>).\n<blockquote>\nA toreador is, or rather was, a gentleman who killed bulls for his own amusement on horseback and with the spear. He was a sportsman, and his sport was as manly and respectable as pig-sticking. A professional fighter who performs in a ring and for money is a torero.
